Orders
======

The orders should be simple and general but very clear.

This permit some discretion on the part of the commander
of the unit. It should not prescribe how to act, just the
result of the action or the intent of the action.

Examples from the wargame rule book are:

Advance and attack enemy to your front.
Demonstrate against the village on the left.
Occupy and hold the round topped hill.
Drive the enemy out of the wood.
Support the Fusiliers.
Remain in reserve.
Delay any enemy attack.
Hold on to the last man. (Yeah, right, general.)
