A Napoleonic War simulation with emphasis on accuracy. 

A no-nonsense war game simulator that will not use flashy graphics but will try to create a realistic simulation of a Napoleonic army with a
minimum of management.

It uses the C++ boost libraries as much as possible. This is a deliberate design decision and may not always result in the fastest code.
Call it showing off if you like, but I would like to demonstrate how elegant and concise C++ can be. And I am not a guru.
